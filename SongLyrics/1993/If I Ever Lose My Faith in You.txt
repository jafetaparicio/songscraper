[Verse 1]
You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in the holy church
You would say I lost my sense of direction
Yes, you could say all of this and worse but

[Chorus]
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

[Verse 2]
Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You would say I lost my belief in our politicians
They all seem like game show hosts to me

[Chorus]
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

[Bridge]
I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes I see your face

[Verse 3]
I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a - a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse but
Let me say this first

[Chorus]
If I ever lose my faith in you
(If I ever lose my faith in you)
There'd be nothing left for me to do
(There'd be nothing left for me to do)
If I ever lose my faith
If I ever lose my faith
If I ever lose my faith
If I ever lose my faith
In you
