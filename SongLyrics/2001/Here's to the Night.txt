[Verse 1]
So denied, so I lied
Are you the now or never kind?
In a day and a day love
I'm gonna be gone for good again
Are you willing to be had?
Are you cool with just tonight?
Here's a toast to all those
Who hear me all too well

[Chorus]
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to goodbye
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon

[Verse 2]
Put your name on the line
Along with place and time
Wanna stay not to go
I wanna ditch the logical

[Pre-Chorus]
Here's a toast to all those
Who hear me all too well

[Chorus]
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to goodbye
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon

[Bridge]
All my time is froze in motion
Can't I stay an hour or two or more?
Don't let me let you go
Don't let me let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Here's a toast to all those
Who hear me all too well

[Chorus]
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to good bye
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon, too soon
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to good bye
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon
