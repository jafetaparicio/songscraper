[Pre-Hook]
Got somebody, she's a beauty
Very special, really and truly
Takes good care of me like it's her duty
Want you right by my side, night and day

[Hook]
No letting go, no holding back
Because you are my lady
When I'm with you it's all a that
Girl, I'm so glad we've made it
No letting go, no holding back
No holding back, no
When I'm with you it's all a that
All a that

[Verse]
They say good things must come to an end
But I'm optimistic about being your friend
Though I made you cry by my doings
With Keisha and Anisha
But that was back then

[Hook]
No letting go, no holding back
Because you are my lady
When I'm with you it's all a that
Girl, I'm so glad we've made it
No letting go, no holding back
No holding back, no
When I'm with you it's all a that
All a that, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Really appreciate you loving me
After all that we've been through
Really appreciate you loving me
All times, time

[Pre-Hook]
Got somebody, she's a beauty
Very special, really and truly
Takes good care of me like it's her duty
Want you right by my side, night and day

[Hook]
No letting go, no holding back
Because you are my lady
When I'm with you it's all a that
Girl, I'm so glad we've made it
No letting go, no holding back
No holding back, no
When I'm with you it's all a that
All a that
