[Intro]
X-X-X-Xeno Carr!

[Chorus: Xeno Carr]
Who do you think you are?
You were sucking dick for a foreign car (Brr-rrr-rrr)
Gotta take that call
They want you at work, so girl, go do your job

[Bridge: Xeno Carr]
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa

[Verse 1: Xeno Carr]
We all have regrets sometimes
We wish to go back in time
(Body, body, body, body) That's a lot of lives
(Video, video) That's a lot of guys, damn
Don't you wish you changed your past?
'Cause it's so bad
Don't you wish you changed your past?
'Cause it's so bad
Mia Khalifa
Is that why you tried to quit three times?
Is that why you said goodbye, retired?
Is that why you said, "Fuck these guys"?

[Chorus: Xeno Carr]
Who do you think you are?
You were sucking dick for a foreign car (Brr-rrr-rrr)
Gotta take that call
They want you at work, so, girl, go do your job

[Bridge: Xeno Carr]
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa
(Mia!) Mia Khalifa
Fight!

[Verse 2: Aqsa]
Hit or miss, I guess they never miss, huh?
You got a boyfriend, I bet he doesn't kiss ya (Mwah!)
He gon' find another girl and he won't miss ya
He gon' skrrt and hit the dab like Wiz Khalifa
You play with them balls like it’s FIFA
You won every level, you’re the leader, ooh
You used to work at Whataburger
Now you pop your pussy for the Warner Brothers
(And that bangs, bro)
Shots fired, you’re fired
You’re washed up, you’re retired
Your kitty looks like a flat tire (Eww!)
I bet that your kitty real tired
Perfect!

[Chorus: Xeno Carr]
Who do you think you are?
You were sucking dick for a foreign car (Brr-rrr-rrr)
Gotta take that call
They want you at work, so girl, go do your job

[Outro: Xeno Carr]
(Mia!)
(Mia!)

(Mia!)
(Mia!)
(Mia!)
You win!
