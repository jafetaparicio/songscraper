[Verse 1: Paula Abdul & The Wild Pair]
Baby, it seems we never ever agree
You like the movies and I like TV
I take things serious and you take 'em light
I go to bed early and I party all night

[Verse 2: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
Our friends are sayin' we ain't gonna last
'Cause I move slowly and baby, I'm fast
I like it quiet and I love to shout
But when we get together, it just all works out

[Chorus: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

[Verse 3: Paula Abdul & The Wild Pair]
Who'd-a thought we could be lovers?
She makes the bed and he steals the covers
She likes it neat and he makes a mess
I take it easy, baby, I get obsessed

[Verse 4: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
She's got the money and he's always broke
I don't like cigarettes and I like to smoke
Things in common? There just ain't a one!
But when we get together, we have nothin' but fun

[Chorus: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract
A two steps forward, a two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

[Breakdown: Paul Abdul and The Wild Pair]
You know it, baby, baby
We come together
We come together

[Verse 5: Paula Abdul & The Wild Pair]
Baby, ain't it somethin' how we lasted this long?
You and me provin' everyone wrong
Don't think we'll ever get our differences patched
Don't really matter 'cause we're perfectly matched

[Chorus: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract
A two steps forward, a two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

[Outro: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
Two steps forward, two steps back
Two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites, opposites attract
It ain't fiction, you know it's a fact
It's a fact
We come together 'cause opposites, opposites
Two steps forward, two steps back
A two steps back
Opposites attract
We go together
We go together
Two steps forward, two steps back
A two steps back
