[Intro]
A new day has come
A new day has come

[Verse 1]
I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and don't shed a tear
Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love

[Chorus]
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears (Drown my fears)
Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun

[Bridge]
A new day has come
A new day has come
Come

[Verse 2]
Where it was dark, now there’s light
Where there was pain, now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love

[Chorus]
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears (Drown my fears)
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun

[Bridge]
A new day has come
A new day has come
(Mmm, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears (Drown my fears)
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come
A new day has come

[Verse 3]
Ohh, a light
Hush, now
I see a light in your eyes
All in the eyes of a boy
(A new day)
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel, with love
(A new day)
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love
(A new day)
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love
(A new day)

[Outro]
Hush, now
(A new day)
Rain come down
(A new day)
