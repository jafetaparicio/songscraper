[Verse 1]
If it weren't for your maturity, none of this would have happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years, I would've been able to control myself
If it weren't for my attention, you wouldn't have been successful and if
If it weren't for me, you would never have amounted to very much

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind, and
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

[Chorus]
We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

[Verse 2]
You're essentially an employee and I like you having to depend on me
You're a kind of protégé, and one day, you'll say you learned all you know from me and
And I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me like a young thing would, and I think I like ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this could get messy
But, ooh, you don't seem to mind
Dude, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

[Chorus]
We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I've more than honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

[Bridge]
What part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept?
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious?

[Verse 3]
Just make sure you don't tell on me, especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly
I might wanna marry you one day, if you watch that weight and keep your firm body

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this could be messy, and
Ooh, I don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

[Chorus]
We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this could get messy, and
Ooh, I don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

[Chorus]
We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this
