tried
even
tell
could
inside
you
still
cold
morning
Sunday
went
where
They
felt
and
On
mind
sit
that
happy
away
are
We
tonight
tight
It
gone
'm
get
're
the
me
times
all
a
out
window
warning
my
looking
call
wish
You
Wonder
ca
though
just
As
thinking
Wish
've
Though
many
someday
So
hold
until
again
to
feeling
n't
off
together
forget
such
remember
know
But
can
came
And
so
day
'll
alone
far
pain
of
stay
without
I
be
was
