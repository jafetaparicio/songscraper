you
would
takes
choice
till
when
sad
time
spent
Hiding
went
That
steaming
's
long
spin
they
play
sound
and
boat
under
mind
smile
but
that
whistle
dance
heart
away
Runnin
as
her
not
break
air
whoa
music
down
find
moments
It
From
'm
ago
tears
hear
once
The
mandolin
chill
Ah
runs
the
we
band
on
lake
laughed
Like
tent
summer
times
cool
about
all
listen
by
go
made
for
do
a
out
bluegrass
my
got
keeping
banjo
Listen
there
A
face
lakeshore
lose
You
it
ca
She
like
As
awhile
've
from
carnival
watch
she
love
blow
change
Now
did
until
Oh
washing
again
Listenin
to
feeling
played
n't
every
low
off
what
'd
know
Down
last
song
drifting
But
came
And
storm
so
'll
turns
roll
of
sidewheel
rain
strong
in
I
think
evening
wind
knew
