will
us
you
blue
still
while
with
goodbye
time
make
only
There
's
they
up
They
and
daddy
mind
bird
short
world
away
if
into
this
makes
carry
very
your
jeans
forever
see
Goodbye
're
What
the
on
toss
Will
want
for
sky
a
them
better
white
journey
Denim
dreams
chance
You
may
though
like
harder
love
change
Oh
best
fading
to
words
ride
patches
never
know
earth
last
great
heaven
young
vanish
turn
And
'll
day
of
now
dancing
be
leave
