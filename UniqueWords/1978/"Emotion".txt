inside
you
cry
ocean
leads
one
Nobody
There
That
soul
's
else
where
at
up
and
apart
star
Tied
that
Wherever
world
heart
are
Tears
if
need
over
this
tonight
lost
find
your
tight
It
'm
see
sorrow
're
the
on
Goodnight
home
clinging
me
In
shining
all
side
come
go
do
a
darling
things
kiss
my
emotion
got
who
there
goodnight
left
heartache
someone
You
just
nobody
've
part
lives
Instead
back
Now
hold
to
done
words
n't
never
river
know
But
And
'll
taken
pillow
of
now
in
I
broken
be
Come
fall
