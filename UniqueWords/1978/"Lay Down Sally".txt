worries
Wo
you
still
with
goodbye
morning
make
rest
There
soon
's
long
Underneath
been
at
and
Lay
rise
that
matters
above
wanting
need
We
down
your
moon
see
arms
night
the
wrong
yourself
nothing
ever
Sally
trying
on
home
want
me
In
all
is
Do
go
do
ai
talk
my
got
Sun
there
say
face
dreamily
someone
You
just
've
love
So
wo
to
n't
velvet
somewhere
know
no
But
can
skies
And
nearly
here
so
Coloring
lay
stay
light
in
I
think
stars
leave
