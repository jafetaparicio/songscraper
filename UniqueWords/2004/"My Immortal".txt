tried
wipe
much
tell
myself
you
still
haunts
would
When
resonating
with
cried
presence
ah
time
These
fears
There
This
's
been
along
behind
that
these
away
sanity
scream
if
childish
not
Your
real
your
gone

tears
once
're
Ah
chased
All
the
wounds
bound
By
My
years
me
by
all
is
voice
my
Suppressed
wish
held
face
dreams
left
You
it
though
just
erase
've
captivate
life
Now
wo
'Cause
to
n't
being
'd
seem
fight
too
have
But
can
And
heal
so
here
lingers
hand
through
alone
pain
of
tired
light
in
I
used
hard
leave
pleasant
