wan
feel
city
darkness
Alternate
much
Chorus
you
still
When
goodbye
Concrete
Nobody
make
street
sirens
's
where
been
at
up
under
faces
four
Cause
away
knows
scream
Staring
Starting
over
getting
roars
down
music
man
your
moon
It
From
see
hear
get
rolls
The
're
midnight
night
neon
taste
the
on
nothing
Moving
In
all
Trying
sun
do
a
out
things
happened
calls
dream
feet
face
na
heat
were
You
going
it
born
walls
just
look
same
like
've
traffic
Where
back
goes
room
take
blood
Now
So
belong
again
said
to
feeling
done
n't
crowd
Beneath
changed
near
river
know
moves
strange
has
But
can
cares
And
run
through
Living
of
tired
light
in
comes
