tried
war
wonder
tell
could
us
you
while
with
surrender
angels
Boys
There
's
sirens
try
they
where
been
sore
They
and
fallen
On
cloud
Reckless
rise
arrows
world
Because
afraid
are
break
fell
this
boys
over
your
moon
Looks
wild
The
're
august
the
trail
on
murder
always
roadside
In
by
is
all
hungered
for
a
glory
figureheads
got
there
A
bloodstain
their
shine
lose
chose
You
calling
it
like
from
telephone
Secrets
Where
back
lovers
Pre-Chorus
Now
new
again
to
welcome
dust
never
close
ringing
way
razors
Wild
have
tame
And
so
'll
edge
far
pain
fire
dancing
in
rain
eyes
