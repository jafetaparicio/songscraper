feel
you
with
stray
when
past
time
running
There
This
street
they
They
and
under
that
sings
We
little
let
your
lack
see
reach
once
Stray
cat
night
All
the
we
me
all
is
by
a
Knowing
Let
there
white
awake
those
chance
it
may
same
awhile
clicks
sleep
lamps
back
goes
enough
today
new
Oh
wo
ends
n't
forgotten
start
what
meter
Keep
no
have
Until
crying
And
so
'll
day
through
saying
forward
stay
without
precious
in
I
end
be
eyes
