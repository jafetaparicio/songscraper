dawn
Then
you
cry
with
goodbye
dreamers
time
magic
only
's
drift
they
whisper
and
clown
that
these
away
bad
if
We
find
walk
Only
It
gone
're
night
the
sandman
help
beautiful
In
all
is
silent
stardust
Can
do
things
talk
my
mine
Just
call
A
say
dreams
awake
sprinkle
then
it
Into
ca
just
like
sleep
right
room
Tiptoes
said
to
n't
every
asleep
together
close
happen
remember
too
candy-colored
But
before
softly
of
Go
prayer
in
I
eyes
Everything
fall
