rose
you
blue
with
seen
everything
Near

Miles
warm
everywhere
Feels
amber
and
most
Out
under
cloud
pale
Touching
away
whatever
air
lost
deep
moments
'm
forever
discovering
melting
night
the
we
ever
shared
always
me
summer
come
for
do
sky
a
got
there
white
spoken
dream
say
timeless
soft
windless
heat
You
it
like
As
heavenly
Of
've
back
Secret
sweetness
love
almost
magical
again
to
words
every
stop
never
together
close
standing
rushing
Everywhere
afternoon
Never
Exotic
days
Say
rains
'll
scent
lay
far
of
Those
light
in
I
eyes
be
stars
Everything
pure
unbelievable
