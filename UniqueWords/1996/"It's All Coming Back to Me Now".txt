tried
Right
even
much
us
Then
myself
you
hours
count
When
with
lies
flashes
than
forgive
cold
when
time
threats
There
went
That
's
long
they
where
whisper
flesh
at
up
resist
somehow
and
whenever
seemed
more
but
that
history
baby
if
need
We
this
deeper
lost
your
moments
It
empty
gone
ago
forever
see
tears
endless
The
coming
allow
All
door
the
banished
we
ever
on
want
always
If
me
all
sun
made
for
do
believe
window
things
kiss
froze
my
Baby
there
left
bed
outside
Drying
or
slamming
were
then
those
it
recall
cruel
ca
just
like
body
instant
back
touch
right
chances
worse
any
hold
again
nights
to
turned
n't
every
admit
fantasies
dust
listened
never
dead
forget
gold
what
'd
remember
laws
last
wasted
memory
But
have
can
days
finished
crying
And
pleasure
so
alone
of
light
had
now
hollow
since
strong
in
I
eyes
wind
how
hurt
hard
was
barely
knew
