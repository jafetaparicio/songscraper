dawn
playing
with
lies
when
thorough-fare
only
There
everywhere
him
along
up
and
around
singing
bird
that
above
heart
guess
sings
as
break
little
fell
this
music
down
'm
hear
melody
The
night
How
the
on
home
My
sun
a
my
town
trip
took
were
birds
it
answer
just
look
from
within
goes
love
keep
tree
sing
did
until
Oh
to
feeling
stopped
every
start
ringing
what
happen
know
he
bells
came
walked
And
reeling
so
through
of
in
I
evening
how
was
Ya-ya-ya-ya
