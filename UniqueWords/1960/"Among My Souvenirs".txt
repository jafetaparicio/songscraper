heart
my
start
chest
as
two
A
rose
you
find
blue
do
letters
left
their
memory
count
or
see
tokens
teardrops
treasure
're
sad
though
just
days
rest
among
photograph
There
from
within
And
Some
give
's
consolation
the
nothing
they
They
of
and
me
apart
few
souvenirs
I
more
be
all
broken
used
best
for
that
a
to
them
