happy
embrace
together
near
heavens
longing
Mama
Then
you
your
these
Safe
When
warmth
with
miss
guide
shadows
were
those
once
recall
The
're
spent
can
Until
days
And
from
tender
That
the
here
day
we
ever
'll
Sent
through
of
years
me
love
replace
live
glow
Nothing
in
I
is
evening
Oh
until
more
memories
fall
that
beside
to
lovely
above
