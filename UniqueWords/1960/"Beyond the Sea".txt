kiss
beyond
heart
never
will
as
her
near
there
We
No
could
Then
'd
know
we
moon
It
golden
sands
arms
watching
waiting
birds
before
just
She
Bye
like
And
soon
Somewhere
the
watches
sailing
's
lover
on
fly
doubt
'll
meet
My
stands
straight
far
me
If
high
ships
sea
lead
So
I
shore
Happy
be
more
stars
again
go
for
that
a
to
long
bye
