kiss
For
heart
my
if
near
lonely
could
starting
know
you
nights
your
while
tears
were
once
Goodbye
was
other
But
The
just
same
Beside
only
How
And
That
tender
Some
from
the
we
long
steal
help
on
Will
told
whispering
They
lights
love
me
saw
old
silvery
sea
brought
hold
I
more
ship
shore
Now
parting
all
is
harbor
to
watched
