feel
yesterday
could
Is
myself
inside
you
cry
everything
one
kills
tall
's
pretend
am
up
felt
and
around
torn
but
Behind
that
these
For
spit
Your
hating
into
let
Seeing
tight
deep
Broken
Here
Ca
'm
see
arms
tears
get
once
Anymore
wrong
the
nothing
on
me
hangin
Seems
all
go
made
for
do
a
out
my
Just
Opened
thought
alright

left
outside
were
then
You
it
ca
hazel
just
like
sleep
part
Swallow
right
told
life
breathe
Now
So
wo
again
blame
'Cause
to
pieces
n't
together
No
what
Unbreakable
But
deny
so
of
now
strong
in
I
eyes
be
broken
used
Everything
barely
