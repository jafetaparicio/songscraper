will
known
vital
still
shadow
everything
signs
one
only
That
's
street
where
up
Sometimes
and
On
mind
lines
shallow
that
heart
Ah-ah
borderline
this
down
find
walk
Broken
empty
'm
divides
The
fucked
What
the
ever
Check
sleeps
home
My
me
walks
all
Do
beside
line
out
a
beating
my
lonely
there
ah-ah
wish
Boulevard
someone
then
it
To
Of
Where
Read
road
right
goes
between
Dreams
to
n't
somewhere
know
walking
thing
But
have
And
'Til
edge
alone
of
in
I
alive
