inside
you
hourglass
breath
ocean
still
When
time
only
's
am
called
and
around
saw
On
crashed
notion
slipped
away
foolish
as
this
find
hear
endless
slow
Through
the
lover
My
me
place
If
In
by
for
a
fated
my
there
returning
say
Haunted
Watching
some
flames
game
Take
unafraid
lovers
take
love
keep
today
to
turned
motion
every
anticipating
somewhere
way
know
secret
waiting
no
Never
ones
turn
And
finally
become
mirror
hesitating
Turning
in
I
shame
