words
n't
away
are
to
mine
bodies
tear
if
follow
wonder
We
ourselves
ours
Love
could
remember
know
music
you
your
dreams
Our
still
plays
When
Mirrored
with
sorrow
a
hear
were
when
upon
morning
The
time
it
skies
touched
And
That
the
we
day
beneath
where
sound
universe
felt
me
had
wildest
In
about
in
I
eyes
think
new
brand-new
greets
care
stars
all
Once
was
knew
Reflected
dew
