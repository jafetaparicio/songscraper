For
hears
splendor

Lips
Antone
my
San
Beneath
as
there
A
rose
Deep
know
known
Enchantments
your
dreams
blue
Call
Broken
memory
would
empty
Alamo
song
strange
with
lies
Well
he
sweet
melody
once
it
petals
own
like
found
only
And
within
tender
moonlit
the
so
Where
back
alone
up
of
live
love
Moon
old
and
apart
Speak
Still
in
I
all
broken
by
stars
pass
again
was
that
beside
a
to
falling
above
