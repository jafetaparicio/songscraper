never
Right
my
that
pick
as
beg
her
looks
there
A
La
rose
la
down
your
moon
coal
soft
It
garden
black

lose
seen
With
Spanish
sweet
then
going
it
when
But
have
one
dreaming
gleaming
only
There
And
concrete
That
soul
the

run
street
watch
on
control
through
she
up
Harlem
growing
and
fire
in
all

eyes
I
pardon
red
stars
sun
comes
special
a
out
grows
