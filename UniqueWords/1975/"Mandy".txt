happy
Crying
away

Looking

Well
tears
Shadows
The
Morning
night
How
sent
the
uphill
ice
on
nothing

A
dream
Raining
face
their
calling
just
realized

Of
life
goes

today
taking
Oh
stopped
Yesterday
kissed
never
way
remember
standing
Caught
memory
shaking
But
came
walked
And
day
edge
through
pain
of
without
climbing
in
I

Happy
pass
was
