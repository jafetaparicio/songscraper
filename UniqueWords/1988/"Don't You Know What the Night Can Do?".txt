Forever
feel
will
playing
inside
you
Wo
When
Time
Spread
should
when
time
flying
There
's
Feels
revealing
and
that
these
heart
are
We
Memories
into
let
this
music
down
your
our
're
midnight
coming
night
All
the
we

help
me
times
all
is
Do

Let

lose
flowing
beat
it
just
To
touching
true
love
Now
hold
taking
again
to
feeling
Know
wings

ride
never
together
what
No

too
Hear

can
crying
turn
finally
good
Feel
so
'll
enfold
through
saying
hide
in
I
be
making
rhythm
