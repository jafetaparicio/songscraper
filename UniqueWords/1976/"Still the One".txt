Deep

When
Changing

Yes
scratch
when

Sometimes

saw
half
snow
that
these
'til
away
are
We
makes
your
our

get
're
the
we
want
whispering
years
me
Still
about
all
is
ear
fun
after
go
for
talk
my
who
better
winter
dream
face
desert

Ooh
wanted
You
going

ca
though
just
've
back
touch
take
love
enough
new
laugh
again
switch
to
n't
every
never
together
gold
way
having
know
longed
head
But
can
came
Wanted
day
Even
itch
turns
old
since
strong
in
I
shout
grows
