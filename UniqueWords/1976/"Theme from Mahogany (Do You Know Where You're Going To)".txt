loved
you
hands
still
When
Why
sad
time
Chasing
's
planned
long
where
at
behind
but
Once
that
are
We
let
must
our
see
spirit
get
once
're
hoping
How
What
door
the
we
wait
me
all
is
Do
free
for
open
things
my
looking
doors
there
dreams
Laughin
showing
were
those
You
going
just
look
like
've
answers
filled
Where
back
life
many
slip
Now
to
fantasies
what
know
standing
questions
no
before
can
minds
so
asked
through
of
in
I
be
how
was
knew
