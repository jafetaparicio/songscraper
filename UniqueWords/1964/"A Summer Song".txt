Laughing
warmth
goodbye

breeze
that
distant
away
must

swayin
the
we
on
kisses

In
by
all

a
window
things
my
Just
say
dream
hurts
their
some

against
To
As
Wish
Showin
Soft
Trees
Gazing
lights
did

nights
to

off
No
know
no
But
have
starry
days
walked
cares
Beats
And
good
sleepy

'll
Sweet
pane
of
rain
in
I
