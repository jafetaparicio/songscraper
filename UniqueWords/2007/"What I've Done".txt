For
out
away
Put
to
start
whatever
forgiving
Na-na
thought
there
what
let
this
myself
you
face
hands
na
From
Today
'm
lies
With
mercy
While
no
truth
may
thousand
To
rest

There
And
What

the
'll
become
clean
pain
of
alibi
and
wash
me
farewell
slate
In
blood
drawn
So
I
regret
Erase
uncertainty
Forgiving
again
come
go
ends
'Cause
a
cross
