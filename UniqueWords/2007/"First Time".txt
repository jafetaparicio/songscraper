feel
says
Feeling
inside
you
breath
Waking
with
time
unknown
's
death
been
at
up
under
both
but
that
Waiting
Wherever
world
For
afraid
easier
Looking
as
We
into
over
this
tonight
lost
find
your
deep
first
It
'm
see
Well
once
're
The
skin
the
wrong
home
Like
me
all
come
for
sky
a
feels
my
looking
something
holding
crashing
chance
it
letting
Into
Reality
As
like
've
she
right
life
love
taking
scared
belong
again
to
feeling
being
maybe
But
dreaming
hide
in
broken
eyes
I
be
alive
