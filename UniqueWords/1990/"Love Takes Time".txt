wan
feel
much
Feeling
inside
you
takes
cold
when
time
Tell
's
Lord
treated
and
around
mind
but
that
Because
away
heart
are
Tears
need
let
this
over
down
From
gone
'm
endlessly
see
incomplete
're
wrong
the
me
all
Trying
go
do
believe
falling
my
say
na
wander
blind
You
it
ca
To
Suddenly
love
slip
Now
Could
hurting
to
n't
escape
stop
Love
Losing
know
miss
But
And
heal
so
here
alone
pain
had
hollow
now
might
rain
in
I
be
care
how
was
