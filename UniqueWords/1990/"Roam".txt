world
kiss
Boy
every
ride
boundaries
to
my
feel
if
air
Skip
anything
down
you
Yeah
sunset
bustin
trip
Whispering
hip
arrow
with
see
dusty
Kick
hear
great
degree
Fly
continents
those
it
rocking
Roam
wilderness
the
we
girl
rock
trails
Take
Around
big
through
Whistling
want
wheels
air-strip
and
love
shooting
around
without
roam
dancing
sea
in
I
target
ear
wind
mercury
Oh
but
begins
sky
a
dirty
wings
