seeing
much
doin
could
Is
trade
you
cry
still
house
would
t
while
with
unspoken
when
There
give
That
pretend
everywhere
been
up
and
most
oh
smile
bother
saved
that
afraid
away
are
gettin
heart
roof
if
not
okay
havin
let
this
over
deal
walk
It
empty
gone
our
see
tears
once
â€™
What
the
on
trying
Was
me
Still
few
all
go
do
a
out
Not
them
my
s
m
force
say
hurts
Gettin
dressed
left
then
watchin
seein
it
though
just
knowing
've
harder
upsets
take
love
goin
again
to
words
every
don
never
being
gets
what
close
know
tryin
losing
But
have
can
days
And
so
Even
alone
pain
of
old
now
rain
in
I
regret
livin
hard
was
friends
