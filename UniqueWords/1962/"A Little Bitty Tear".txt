away
heart
my
tear
as
not
tomorrow
there
A
little
let
'd
could
down
stand
you
your
frown
last
left
another
our
really
sorrow
Till
with
goodbye
were
waiting
You
spoiled
it
no
when
have
wave
bitty
make
walked
like
And
went
That
door
leaving
the
planned
day
put
act
on
grip
funny
through
Pull
up
quite
felt
me
clown
had
In
today
I
be
laugh
but
made
said
was
that
go
Everything
a
out
show
