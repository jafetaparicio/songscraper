feel
could
myself
you
passing
cry
Life
million
should
when
went
where
They
forgot
and
minute
away
heart
Wishing
Since
man
down
tight
your
It
empty
gone
each
see
tears
The
're
night
cries
the
help
on
My
keeps
hour
me
by
seems
go
free
do
a
my
lonely
say
holds
You
it
a-hurtin
ca
sleep
right
Now
hold
broke
Every
to
n't
every
set
never
memory
head
But
can
breaks
And
so
day
lay
pillow
of
since
think
I
instead
