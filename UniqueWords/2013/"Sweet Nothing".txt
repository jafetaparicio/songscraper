tell
you
When
with
giving
unknown
There
give
's
whisper
word
at
and
both
that
heart
away
are
not
air
let
this
your
It

'm
're
living
worst
swallowed
the
we
put
on
nothing
trying
me
Nothing
all
by
is
go
for
a
out
my
mine
there
held
something
faith
took
You
it
sigh
Emptied
've
easy
mouth
love
enough
learn
So
hold
'Cause
to
words
n't
every
such
know
rushing
sweet
But
came
And
Sweet
of
hollow
now
in
I
care
Eats
single
hard
