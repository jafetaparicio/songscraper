Staring
need
her
let
your
deep
Only
empty
see
Well

're
slow
the
home
bottom
sun
go
come
a
understand
dream
dreams

You

burning
Hoping
road
touch
goes
love
missing
high
keep
glass
why
Oh
'Cause
to
feeling
asleep
Whoa
low
never
Maybe
close
know
too
last
miss
dark
But
And
so
day
'll
of
light
old
in
Same
eyes
Everything
comes
fall
dived
