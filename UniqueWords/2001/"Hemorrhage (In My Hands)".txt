tried
feel
even
myself
you
hands
lies
when
Drag
only
give
where
up
and
behind
but
lines
that
'til
away
are
Am
her
Memories
over
find
What
cries
the
Was
me
place
In
is
Do
go
do
expect
them
my
bleeding
waters
white
Dead
something
their
left
black
depths
Leave
wanted
You
it
just
She
like
've
faking
she
life
love
actors
did
hold
Oh
movie
again
said
to
n't
never
dead
Love
remember
anything
Oooh
turn
contagious
And
Some
Over
now
in
I
Woah
fall
leave
