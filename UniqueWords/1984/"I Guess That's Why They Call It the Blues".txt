could
inside
you
hands
thunder
while
Laughing
with
Time
than
stare
time
spent
only
That
's
long
Wait
they
where
at
and
under
more
that
space
Cry
away
guess
hesitation
if
into
man
your
our
blues
'm
forever
each
Dust
get
itself
living
night
the
we
ever
on
hearts
me
place
Do
Picture
for
out
things
my
children
Just
better
call
wish
say
covers
face
Laughin
it
look
To
like
demons
girl
lovers
life
love
wo
why
second
More
Live
n't
never
helps
forget
But
simply
before
can
Rollin
And
run
without
hide
Between
in
I
honestly
be
livin
