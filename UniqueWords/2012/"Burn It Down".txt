When
when
one
fix
at
up
struck
burn
but
that
Waiting
as
We
break
into
let
this
down
lost
find
your
tearing
The
're
All
the
wait
Was
me
explosions
conflicted
sky
soldier
my
there
crown
held
colors
blazes
clouds
were
wanted
You
it
flames

As
from
burning
believed
ring
back
told
right
take
high
glow
So
hold
climbed
broke
repeated
built
to
cycle
played
n't
kissed
stop
know
Caught
thing
lie
building
yes
But
turn
And
'll
ground
in
I
fall
was
king
