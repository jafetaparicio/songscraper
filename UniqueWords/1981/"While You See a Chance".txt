theres
wonder
you
blue
still
When
should
cold
when
morning
sad
one
time
up
quite
oh
Thats
more
gives
that
Because
worth
your
see
moving
Stand
endless
clear
How
the
dawning
on
nothing
all
by
is
free
Can
believe
fake
a
unwinds
dream
Find
left
some
finds
While
chance
going
it
its
blowing
knowing
Dont
deceive
road
take
keep
Alone
One
gray
to
tomorrow
what
No
way
reminds
know
anything
Are
romance
dont
no
can
Until
And
day
Even
old
now
in
be
wind
how
leave
