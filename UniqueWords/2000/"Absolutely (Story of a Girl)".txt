hope
mouths
drowned
you
insincere
When
would
while
with
cried
sad
shoes
only
Who
This
long
up
quite
and
falls
absolutely
promises
but
that
world
story
choose
as
her
Your
this
real
your
our
tears
get
're
smiles
hid
How
the
we
put
stands
soles
woke
all
is
for
do
a
out
things
holes
Just
lonely
looks
there
A
stand
say
photographs
Watching
face
year
well
or
You
She
look
As
same
found
Making
from
girl
whole
lovers
she
price
love
many
So
Now
did
today
Wearing
wear
to
words
every
clothes
never
way
river
seem
walking
too
next
waiting
disappear
But
can
days
hair
And
so
here
day
run
mirror
far
of
stay
in
I
be
wind
how
pretty
