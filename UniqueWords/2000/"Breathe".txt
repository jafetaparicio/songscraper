feel
Is
you
settle
When
with
than
magic
lying
fades
only
There
's
been
up
and
felt
breeze
that
world
dance
away
heart
need
air
into
this
over
waking
down
your
'm
arms
hear
The
slow
melting
prove
steady
All
the
we
supposed
ever
on
nothing
me
sunlight
In
all
is
across
come
for
a
Being
beating
my
Baby
Just
face
left
closer
it
walls
just
As
've
watch
whole
touch
right
thoughts
love
breathe
washing
rush
'Cause
to
words
n't
swept
gets
way
seem
know
Caught
thing
tumbling
no
Never
can
before
And
floating
suddenly
of
now
in
I
be
wrapped
