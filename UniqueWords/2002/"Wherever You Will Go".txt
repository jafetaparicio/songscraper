hope
will
darkest
could
us
Then
you
still
When
would
with
shadows
time
own
make
Who
's
been
up
quite
and
mind
away
heart
need
down
find
your
wherever
gone
'm
stone
lately
Through
bring
the
on
My
If
place
me
In
all
go
for
a
out
Way
my
mine
there
A
face
or
then
someone
it
Run
just
To
watch
back
take
love
life
high
wondering
between
someday
So
Could
to
low
maybe
way
know
sand
guide
great
shall
upon
wave
can
days
turn
And
'll
of
stay
light
might
now
in
I
be
how
fall
