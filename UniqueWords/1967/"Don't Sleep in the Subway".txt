Then
pouring
reason
Or
you
coat
realize
When
means
million
when
own
That

long
pretend
try
else
'cause
disagree
compromise
and
darlin
around
apart
oh
ego
On
cloud
both
over-rated
are
foolish
not
repeat
little
your
walk
see
The

night
door
Good-bye
the

wrong
on
nothing
me
times
Nothing
Um-m-um-um-um-um
all
is
Do
show
go
for
Forget
do
beside
a
out
chorus
smart
my
stand
hurts
wander
Ooh
You
it
pride
've
fade
subway

Take
take
wherefore
love
Now
So
Oh
why
again
to
n't
off
close
what
deflated
somewhere
before
problems
And
so
heard
rain
in
I
be
care
