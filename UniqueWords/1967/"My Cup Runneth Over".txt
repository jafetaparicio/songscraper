n't
are
Just
will
runneth
We
not
even
over
notice
you
cup
deep
constantly
these
moments
When
lie
'm
see
With
watching
memorize
shadows
small
You
cold
sometimes
morning
The
thinking
And
only
What
That
sleep
the
here
so
study
whisper
My
Sometimes
of
love
moment
old
sunlight
In
in
I
evening
both
be
wo
do
beside
a
turning
fondest
above
