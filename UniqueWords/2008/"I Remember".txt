wan
will
could
myself
loved
inside
you
still
would
cried
promised
when
sad
one
Nobody
rest
There
went
else
hated
where
gave
at
up
somehow
and
oh
more
loving
saved
hey
Waiting
For
heart
plus
deep
first
Thinking
night
All
the
we
screamed
shared
My
me
telling
times
all
go
made
for
out
Remember
my
nowhere
lonely
stormed
na
were
it
just
kept
sleep
Where
take
love
life
So
Oh
broke
said
Did
to
n't
genuinely
No
remember
know
no
But
turn
walked
Sad
And
so
through
pain
of
without
in
I
be
was
leave
knew
