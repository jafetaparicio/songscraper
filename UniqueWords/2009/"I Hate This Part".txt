takes
lies
goodbye
cold

We

your
It

tears
once
're
The
slow
Thought
radio
All
the
we

on
nothing
bound
talked
me

Seems
all
is
by

Got

Slipping
it
overdue
ca
just
To
same
like
ta
routine
sleep
part
Where
right
take
between
worse
Now
any
hold
Oh
hurting
'Cause

stronger
what
way
know
laws
sunset
driving
slipping
no
But
before
can
And
so
here
Avenue
'll
scene
through
of
old
now
since
longer
fingers
in
I
end
eyes
linger
