inside
you
When
really
should
bear
Held
morning
time
one
make
There
soul
's
control
and
Night
loving
slowly
that
world
heart
Goin
Oooohh
let
lost
down
your
Here
It
gone
tears
died
're
Burning
cries
the
on
home
me
In
all
go
do
beside
a
got
nowhere
lonely
town
holding
lose
Holding
With
it
ca
just
burning
part
take
love
wo
why
to
feeling
n't
yearning
drown
Aaahhhh
tragedy
know
Down
lie
Tragedy
no
And
day
Loving
alone
of
in
I
be
hard
