Galveston
afraid
to
my
her
Standing
there
Your
water
lookin
dream
standing
your
still
left
When
crashing
see
dark
flashing
hear
tears
cannons
While
twenty-one
waiting
At
birds
dying
She
crying
And
flying
glowin
the
watch
we
run
am
gun
so
where
's
she
clean
waves
of
dry
me
winds
oh
sea
for
I
eyes
by
is
On
Before
used
in
sun
was
beach
blowin
out
